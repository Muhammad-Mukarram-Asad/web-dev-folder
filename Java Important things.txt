It is important in java at the time of printing the array of any type :
System.out.println(" Printing array:" + Arrays.toString(arr));

An array stores a sequence of values that are all of the same type. We want not just to store values but
also to be able to quickly access each individual value. The length of an array is established when the
array is created. After creation, its length is fixed. Each item in an array is called an element, and each
element is accessed by its numerical index. The method that we use to refer to individual values in an
array is to number and then index them—if we have n values, we think of them as being numbered from 0
to n−1.
Making an array in a Java program involves involves three distinct steps:
● Declare the array name.
● Create the array.
● Initialize the array values.
We refer to an array element by putting its index in square brackets after the array name.
To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array and specify
the array’s element type. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable:

String Class in Java
import java.lang.String

Math Class in Java
import java.lang.Math   or  java.lang.Math.* ;
