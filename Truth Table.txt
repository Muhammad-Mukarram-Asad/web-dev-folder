A.salamualaikum
My Name Is Mukarram Asad.

Here i am making a Truth Table Of Digital Logic Gates.
Basically there are three basic types of Logic Gates and there names are given below:
1) OR Gate
2) AND Gate
3) NOT Gate

* The OR gate means Addition.
* The AND gate means Multiplication.
* The NOT gate means Inverter means (it inverts the inputs).
 The Combinaions are given or found by the formula which is given below:
>>  No. of combinations =  2^n
 Like if we have two elements then total number of combinartions are = 4.
 
 A    B   A'   B'   A+B    A*B  A'+B  (A')*B   A+(B')  A*(B')   (A+B)'  (A*B)'
 0    0   1    1     0      0     1      0       0      0         1        1
 0    1   1    0     1      0     1      1       0      0         0        1
 1    0   0    1     1      0     0      0       1      1         0        1
 1    1   0    0     1      1     1      0       1      0         0        0
 
 Hence thats all for today.
